# Docs Workspace

This is a workspace, not a documentation folder.

The purpose of this workspace is collate all the docs from any workspaces that contains a `_docs` folder at it's root, and publish them to the internal developer platforms tech-docs site.

It can contain it's own `_docs` folder, that will be treated as a root documentation folder, so anything like general `getting-started` docs should live here

Currently investigating docosaurus as a tool to produce this output

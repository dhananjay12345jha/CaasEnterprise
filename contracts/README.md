# Contracts Workspace

The purpose of this workspace is maintain and manage APIs and schemas that this reposiory is the mater of, and publish specs to the internal developer platforms api-docs site.

API specs for external systems can be stored here (vendored in) if an accessible version is not available - such as a downstream SaaS providers API.

Currently investigating docosaurus as a tool to produce this output
